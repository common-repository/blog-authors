Blog Authors is a WordPress plugin that allows you to display your site’s team members,  and authors to embed their author card.

== Description ==

Blog Authors is an easy-to-manage WordPress plugin that allows you to display your site’s team members. Blog has options to display a page of all team members using a short code. Blog authors also has the option to  show a Blog Author Card under their post. Site owners can enable a feature that allows authors to embed their blog authors card to show their profile. If enabled, there is a list of the ten latest posts by that author. The Blog Authors options panel has options to add and order users. Blog Authors automatically takes each team member’s information based on their profile. Several other fields in the user’s profile are added such as social networking paths and are only visible to users added to blog authors. Blog Authors uses the added social network paths and displays the social networking icons. The overall design is heavily customizable. It comes with a submenu dedicated to customizing the presentation of the the Blog Author Card. The beauty of Blog Authors is that the information is provided by the added user via their profile.
